//! The registry has the purpose to compactify types and strings found in type
//! definitions and identifiers such as symbol names.
//!
//! This is done by deduplicating common strings and types in order to reuse
//! their definitions which can grow arbitrarily large. A type is uniquely
//! identified by its type identifier that is therefore used to refer to types
//! and their definitions.
//!
//! Since symbol names etc. are often shared between different types they are
//! as well deduplicated.
//!
//! Types with the same name are uniquely identifiable by introducing namespaces.
//! For this the normal Rust namespace of a type is used where it has been defined it.
//! Rust prelude types live within the so-called root namespace that is just empty.
//! In general namespaces are ordered sequences of symbols and thus also profit from
//! string deduplication.
